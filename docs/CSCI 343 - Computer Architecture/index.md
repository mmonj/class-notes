## CSCI 343 Computer Architecture (Fluture)

Any guides posted below will use the methods that you are expected to use for this class. If any supplemental video uses different notation or methods, I will try to make a note of it, since not using the professor's method 1:1 will result in you not being granted any points for your answers on quizzes/exams.

### Week 1 & 2

- [Guide: Create a MUX from a Boolean function](./guides/Guide%201%20%2D%20Create%20a%20MUX%20from%20a%20Boolean%20function.pdf) - Uses in-class example. [Supplemental video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_cnctZqk-s) that gives a general idea for how the guide's approach works, though it doesn't exactly follow the guide's method 1:1
- [ROM Basics \[Video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX0F5Xz_f9o)
- [Binary Adder & Subtractor \[Video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o87GH5U1zUY)
- [Binary Adder & Subtractor (alternate) \[Video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7gPUP0aRug) - Has accurate subtitles
- [Binary Adder & Subtractor supplement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o22PeIImcKc) - Relevant info from 00:00 - 06:15
- [1-bit ALU \[Video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9EA-XBbRgg)
- [32-bit ALU \[Video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzCIxPCfEP0)
- [32-bit ALU - Comparison Operations (equality, less than)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajESmB0qJjc)
- [32-bit ALU - Detecting overflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4yVpZGZ9tA)
- [Karnaugh Map with Don't Cares \[Video\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaKVzgiekrA)
- [Guide: Digital Clock & K-Map with Don't Cares](./guides/Guide%202%20-%20Digital%20Clock.pdf) - Uses in-class example. [Supplemental video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akMqyi-0RsY) that uses WXYZ as inputs instead of the expected I<sub>3</sub> I<sub>2</sub> I<sub>1</sub> I<sub>0</sub>
