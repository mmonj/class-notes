## CSCI 343 Computer Architecture (Fluture)

### Week 1 & 2

Any guides posted below will use the methods that you are expected to use for this class. If any supplemental video uses different notation or methods, I will try to make a note of it, since not using the professor's method 1:1 will result in you not being granted any points for your answers on quizzes/exams.

- [Guide: Create a MUX from a Boolean function](./guides/Guide%201%20%2D%20Create%20a%20MUX%20from%20a%20Boolean%20function.pdf) - This guide shows the method you should use for this class. [Here is an example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_cnctZqk-s) that gives a general idea for how the guide's approach works, though it doesn't exactly follow the prof's method 1:1
- [ROM Basics [Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX0F5Xz_f9o)
- [Binary Adder & Subtractor [Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o87GH5U1zUY)
- [Karnaugh Map with Don't Cares [Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaKVzgiekrA)
- [Digital Clock & K-Map with Don't Cares [Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akMqyi-0RsY) - This video uses WXYZ as inputs. For this class, make sure to instead use I<sub>3</sub> I<sub>2</sub> I<sub>1</sub> I<sub>0</sub> as inputs.
